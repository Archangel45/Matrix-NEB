This file contains general notes for things which need to be done.

Plugins
-------
- Add helper classes for plugins (many plugins will pull from A to dump in B, and
this can be factored out)
- Store ALL THE STATE in rooms, there shouldn't be config files lying around.
- Make rooms read-only where they need to be.
- Allow certain users to do special things? (op user list)

Potential APIs
--------------
- Remote social/news: RSS, Digg, Reddit, Pinterest, Tumblr, Facebook, G+, BBC(?)
- Remote computation: Google, Wolfram Alpha, Dictionary/Thesaurus, Currency conversions, Weather, Transport info
- Local computation: Conversion of units (lb/kg, oct/hex/dec, etc)
- Randoms: Urban define, XKCD, random small games (rock/paper/scissors), emotes e.g. !fluffle
- Chat integration: IRC


Protocol considerations
-----------------------
- Keep text / images / etc as standard m. formats
- Custom state events per plugin (to store plugin specific info, namespaced)
- Wary about introducing new message event types, maybe a neb.command so they
  can be silenced from other users?
